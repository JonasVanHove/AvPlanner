-- IMMEDIATE FIX: Resolve 406 and 500 API errors
-- This addresses both teams (406) and members (500) table issues

-- Step 1: Completely reset teams table access (fixes 406 error)
ALTER TABLE teams DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Clean slate for teams
DO $$
DECLARE
    pol RECORD;
BEGIN
    -- Drop ALL policies on teams table
    FOR pol IN SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'teams' AND schemaname = 'public'
    LOOP
        EXECUTE format('DROP POLICY IF EXISTS %I ON teams', pol.policyname);
    END LOOP;
END $$;

-- Re-enable with minimal policy
ALTER TABLE teams ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Single policy for all access types
CREATE POLICY "teams_full_access" ON teams
    FOR ALL
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Grant all permissions to fix API access
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON teams TO anon, authenticated;

-- Step 2: Fix members table (fixes 500 error)
ALTER TABLE members DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Clean slate for members
DO $$
DECLARE
    pol RECORD;
BEGIN
    -- Drop ALL policies on members table
    FOR pol IN SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'members' AND schemaname = 'public'
    LOOP
        EXECUTE format('DROP POLICY IF EXISTS %I ON members', pol.policyname);
    END LOOP;
END $$;

-- Re-enable with minimal policy
ALTER TABLE members ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Single policy for all access types
CREATE POLICY "members_full_access" ON members
    FOR ALL
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Grant all permissions
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON members TO anon, authenticated;
