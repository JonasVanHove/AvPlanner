-- CRITICAL HOTFIX: Complete RLS reset for teams table
-- This will immediately fix the 500 error on team lookup

-- Step 1: Completely disable RLS on teams table temporarily
ALTER TABLE teams DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 2: Remove ALL existing policies that might cause conflicts
DO $$
BEGIN
    -- Drop all possible policy names that might exist
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teams are viewable by everyone" ON teams;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teams can be viewed by authenticated users" ON teams;

    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teams viewable by all" ON teams;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        NULL; -- Ignore errors if policies don't exist
END $$;

-- Step 3: Re-enable RLS with the simplest possible policy
ALTER TABLE teams ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 4: Create one simple policy for all access
CREATE POLICY "teams_public_read" ON teams
    FOR SELECT
    USING (true);

-- Step 5: Ensure proper grants
GRANT SELECT ON teams TO anon, authenticated;

-- Step 6: Fix members table as well to prevent cascading issues
ALTER TABLE members DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Remove all problematic members policies
